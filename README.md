## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for building the backend.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing flag data.
- **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript templating for rendering HTML views.
- **Body-parser**: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
- **CSS**: Used for basic styling of the web pages.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the application locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flag-quiz.git
   cd flag-quiz
   ```

2. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   - Make sure Node.js and npm are installed on your machine.
   - You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file:**
   - In the root of your project directory, create a `.env` file to store your database credentials securely.
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
   - Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_USER=your_postgres_user
   DATABASE_HOST=localhost
   DATABASE_NAME=World
   DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
   DATABASE_PORT=5432
   ```

## Database Setup

1. **Install PostgreSQL:**
   - Make sure PostgreSQL is installed on your machine.
   - You can download it from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

2. **Create the Database:**
   - Create a database named `World` and a table `flags`:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE World;

   \c World

   CREATE TABLE flags (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
     flag VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
   );

   INSERT INTO flags (country, flag) VALUES ('France', 'ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·'), ('United Kingdom', 'ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§'), ('United States', 'ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸');
   ```

3. **Configure Database Connection:**
   - The database connection is configured in your application using the `.env` file. Make sure the values match your local PostgreSQL setup.

## Running the Application
